# japan-life-expectancy-analysis
Exploratory and descriptive data analysis of life expectancy across Japan’s prefectures using Python. Includes visualizations, correlation analysis, and predictive projections based on health, education, income, and labor variables. Designed as a public health case study using real-world data.

##  Project Objectives

- Identify key variables related to life expectancy in Japan.
- Visualize patterns and outliers using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- Analyze correlations between life expectancy and variables like education, income, and healthcare.
- Simulate a 2030 projection based on realistic policy improvements.
- Provide actionable recommendations for public health strategies.

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Japan Life Expectancy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gianinamariapetrascu/japan-life-expectancy)
- The dataset contains data from all 47 Japanese prefectures, with variables including healthcare expenditure, average working hours, income per capita, education levels, and more.

##  Key Findings

- Higher university education, income per capita, and public health investment are associated with longer life expectancy.
- Prefectures like Nara, Kyoto, and Shiga consistently perform better.
- A simulated projection for 2030 showed that small improvements in key areas could increase average life expectancy from **84.53 to 84.8 years**.
